## **Project Overview**
This project provides actionable insights from a retail sales dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes detailed records on product sales, profitability, customer segments, and regional trends. The main objective is to identify key sales patterns and recommend strategies to optimize revenue and profit.

## **Problem Statement**
Retail businesses need to understand which products sell best, where sales are highest, and how discounts impact profit to make informed decisions. This analysis aims to uncover:
- Top-performing products and categories
- Regional sales performance
- Customer segment contributions
- Discount and profitability trends

## **Tools Used**
**Microsoft Excel:** Primary tool for data cleaning, exploration, pivot analysis, and visualization.

**Pivot Tables:** For in-depth breakdowns of sales, profit, discount, and regional performance.

**Charts & Dashboard:** For interactive visuals and executive summaries to communicate insights effectively.

## **Data Cleaning**
- Checked for and removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
- Handled missing values by verifying data consistency (e.g., no blank product names or sales figures).
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., product categories and region names) for consistency in pivot tables.
- Verified numerical fields (sales, profit, discount) for outliers and corrected obvious data entry errors.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Created Pivot Tables to analyze sales, profit, and discounts by product, category, region, and segment.
- Visualized trends with bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for easy stakeholder interpretation.
- Identified relationships between discount rates and profit margins.
- Segmented data to reveal high-revenue customer groups.
